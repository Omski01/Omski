                    <p>After adding the video games section I haven't worked on the site in a while. Haven't really had many ideas on what to add and with lack of ideas I start to lack motivation to work on it. Thought I'd atleast add a blog post about something while I think about what next to add. I'm thinking of doing something with the background and overall look of the site, but it's hard to think of something original. Maybe I should work on arts section, but I think I will rarely post there, as I am not a person who shares what he draws often, which I thought about changing when I was making this website. Overall, I would want to have this site as a portfolio of sorts, for future references and whatnot. But right now, the site still seems a bit scuffed. Although, I will admit that this is my longest-going project that I've worked on, or atleast most loved one. I really enjoyed working on it, even through all the difficulties, after a long long while of writing no code. It was fun to come back and I hope I can continue to do so, but for now I lack ideas. Bing Soy really inspired me to make this, but I don't want to copy his whole website, because I already keep seeing quite a bit of similarities, and while it's not a bad thing to have slight similarity (I mean, it is made with inspiration, right?), but I do prefer to have my own bit of spice or some sort of originality.</p>

                    <p> What a day. Woke up sleepy to the point of feeling like I will fall asleep while walking. Work was messy but it is what it is. Came back, helped da gf clean up. Finally sat down to work on the site, thought to myself "Today I'll add two pages for my hobbies, gaming and art, and I'll make it a drop-down menu from the About section of the header!". Yeah, no. Didn't even start the pages, but it's fine. I've been working for around 4 hours on the drop-down menu and still did not manage to make it work the way I want it to. Current version is very rough, I'm leaving it as is so I could come back to it. Positive thing, I tried to actually ask the CoPilot to point me in the directions of solving the issues in the code instead of just copying it. Atleast did so for a while, but this drop-down is taking too long. Will come back to it later tho, I told myself two hours ago that I'll go play some TF2. Gotta think too. </p>

                    <p> I've been doing some more work, to fix the re-sizing issue with different screens was a hassle, but I'm glad that GitHub CoPilot exists, makes this way more easier and faster, which let's me put more of creativeness to work while still inspired to work on the site. I'm interested in seeing what the future holds for this website and hope that I don't quit on it. Should add something about my hobbies.</p>

                    <p>The day I started working on this website. Inspired by Bing Soy, I think it was a good idea to rekindle some old flames for art and web programming.</p>
