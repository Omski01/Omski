                    <p> I've been doing some more work, to fix the re-sizing issue with different screens was a hassle, but I'm glad that GitHub CoPilot exists, makes this way more easier and faster, which let's me put more of creativeness to work while still inspired to work on the site. I'm interested in seeing what the future holds for this website and hope that I don't quit on it. Should add something about my hobbies.</p>

                    <p>The day I started working on this website. Inspired by Bing Soy, I think it was a good idea to rekindle some old flames for art and web programming.</p>
